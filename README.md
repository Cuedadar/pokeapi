# Knowledge Check - Advanced JS / Async / Fetch

This project demonstrates my understanding of fetching from an API and updating the DOM.

**A live version of the site can be found at *[Netlify](https://jtking-pokeapi.netlify.app/)***

The website uses Bootstrap 5 and vanilla Javascript to search the pokeapi https://pokeapi.co/ and display basic results.

The index.html is your starting point into the website. JS and CSS can be found in their respective folders.

If I were to re-visit this project, there's a TON of data attached to each pokemon. It might be fun to build out a styled Pokedex.
